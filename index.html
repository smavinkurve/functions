      <h1> Career Web (Magnetic?) Haiku </h1>
        <p class="introduction-text">Career Web Magnetic Haiku was made to provide respite from having to summarize your existence into an elevator pitch. The act of writing cover letters, countless applications, and repositioning yourself on your website is deeply exhausting. This project helps you use words to shake you out of your exasperation. Use it to make relevant answers to these prompts or completely unhinged haiku.
        You get a limited set of words. The challenge is to make the most of that limitation. The parameters will force you to think outside the box.</p>

        <p class="header">What is a Haiku? </p>
        <p class="introduction-text">According to Wikipedia, Haiku is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan. Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 phonetic units (or syllables) in a 5, 7, 5 pattern. In this case, we will use words.</p>

        <p class="header"> How to play? </p>
        <p class="introduction-text">Drag and drop the words into each container based on the prompt given above. You can shuffle the prompts to find one that interests you. You can save your work as a PDF for reference later. </p>
        <button> <a href="prompt.html"> Let's Go! </a> </button>

        <p class="header"> Don't want to play? </p>
        <p class="introduction-text">It’s okay! Maybe you got here by accident. Maybe you’re great at talking about yourself. Maybe elevator pitches are your thing! No judgment! </p>
